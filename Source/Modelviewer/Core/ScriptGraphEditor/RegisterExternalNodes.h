// Example file for how to register nodes in another project, i.e. not inside MuninGraph.lib.
// To get all the nodes inside MuninGraph in your project to auto-register you need to link
// with /WHOLEARCHIVE:MuninGraph.lib or VS will optimize the auto reg away. Similarly if you
// have this file in a lib of your own you need to /WHOLEARCHIVE that file too. If this lives
// in an EXE project then it'll work as intended on its own.

// NOTE THE INCLUDE!
